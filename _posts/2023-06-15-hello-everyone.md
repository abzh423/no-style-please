This is my inaugural post on this website, and I hope my journey will be a satisfying one. I'm not particularly fond of studying at my university due to the individuals who work there and the community surrounding it, but I suppose it's tolerable.

The purpose of this website is to offer a glimpse into my personal world. I aim to establish an online presence where people can readily identify me and say, "Oh, I know this person. He's the one that has a blog."
